#TCPhotos500px

TCPhotos500px is a sample iPad app that uses 500px's API to explore its beautiful photo streams.

It displays the thumbnails from the photo stream in a standard `UICollectionView`. When a thumbnail is selected, it will zoom in to display the photo in an overlay modal view. Dismissing the photo will zoom it back out to the thumbnail.

* "Pull-to-Refresh" to get the latest photos from 500px's photo stream.
* Minimalist UI built using FlatUIKit.
* Supports all device orientations.
* Uses iOS 6's Auto Layout features to make it easier to transition to iOS 7.
* Full source code provided and project files are organised clearly in a MVC structure.
